# blogs_restapi
A blog container RESTful API
So this is all about integrating the node.js core modules with express.js routing to build a complete RESTful API. It is controlled by CLI with the help of readline module and the blogs list is not a static list inside the code itself, but its a json file and we accessed it using filesystem module and path module. So this REST API is a wholesome integration of my node.js and express.js skills
